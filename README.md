[Prediction of Age & Gender through Deep Learning.](https://2039972919.github.io/Suresh_Yarramsetty/)


Predicting the age and gender of an individual is harder than one thinks because such a prediction demands accuracy and consistency. Afraid if you should put your pedal in this challenging project! If you are a beginner and planning to impress your interviewer with critical thinking and CNN (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network) Implementation, this project would be an ideal choice for drawing the attention of the panel members. The prime aim is to detect the age and gender of a person after analyzing his/her picture. For accomplishing this, we will be using a DL model (rather than a regression model), package OpenCV, and dataset Audience. But some challenges would be there which we can’t afford to ignore. They are dim lighting, out-of-the-way facial expressions, and cosmetics applied on the skin. With them, it is possible to have multiple incompetencies while predicting larger degrees of variations during age prediction and gender detection. Henceforth, such challenges coming forward in the form of anomalies mustn’t be neglected. Instead, we should cross-check if their occurrence exists and focus more on filtering thousands of ages and genders tuning well with the exact identification of the age and gender.
